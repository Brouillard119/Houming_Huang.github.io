📆 2024.3 - 2024.6  
💼 Graduation Thesis  

· Briefly describe the problems existing in the field of road traffic management in China from the past to the present day and the significance of applying intelligent traffic management technology and management methods. Introduce the relevant basic theories and technologies and combs through its development history. Explain the main research content of this thesis, the experimental work, and the arrangement of each chapter.

· Elaborate the theoretical knowledge and technical introduction of convolutional neural network algorithm models and other related topics. Give a brief explanation of the concept of convolutional neural networks, common threshold functions used in model applications, learning and training algorithms, image convolution principles, and relevant performance evaluation indicators for models.

· Build the machine learning Random Forest and SVM models for car license plate recognition detection using Scikit-Learn. The steps include image data preprocessing, model building, setting model parameters, completing the training of the model, test sets testing, and outputting the corresponding performance evaluation indexes.

· Complete the construction of the convolutional neural network car license plate recognition model using Pytorch, complete the iterative training of the model, and test the model generated after training on test datasets, generate visual test results and analyze them. Meanwhile, make innovative improvements to address the limitations and deficiencies of the current convolutional neural network model. Improve the performance of the model and pursue better model recognition and detection results. For example, using the Softmax function to probabilistically generate outputs and setting threshold conditions to make the model's recognition criteria clear.

· Make brief summaries of the thesis's research work and findings obtained. Make further outlook on the related research work on convolutional neural network models, such as optimization, iteration, etc.

📆 2023.9 - 2024.1  
💼 Financial Data Mining  

· Investment Analysis of Listed Companies: Obtain data from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, select indicators such as overall scale model, investment efficiency, and value growth, to use the principal component analysis model to extract comprehensive principal components and conduct ranking. Select the top 20 or 40 stocks to construct an investment portfolio and calculate the return for a certain holding period. Meanwhile, compare the return with the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index for the same period and conduct a quantitative investment analysis.  

· Stock Price Prediction: Select indicators such as trend, overbought and oversold, and popularity, and use these indicators as independent variables. The dependent variable takes the direction of stock price rise and fall on the next trading day, with an increase represented by +1, otherwise, it is -1. Calculate the independent and dependent variables with a certain calculation period as training samples, and calculate the dependent variable with a subsequent period as testing samples to predict the direction of its rise and fall to complete the design and analysis of the quantitative investment.  

· Morphological Feature Extraction Based on Key Price Points: Based on actual stock trading data, extract the morphological characteristics of price fluctuations, use the clustering analysis method to automatically cluster the morphological characteristic data, and calculate the average return rate of each class of stocks with a future holding period of one month based on the clustering results. Then, the top 5 stocks with the highest average class return are labelled as +1 classes, and the remaining stocks are labelled as -1 classes as training samples, which are trained using a support vector machine model. Finally, use the trained SVM model to predict the new stock price morphology feature data to derive a quantitative trading strategy.

📆 2023.5  
💼 Data Mining Course Practicum

· Use Python to model the bank loan behaviour, and use data mining techniques to find and analyze the relationship between different population characteristics (education level, personal asset scale, married or not) and bank loan behaviour. The specific steps successively include data set selection, data preprocessing, data association analysis, and data clustering analysis. Make an academic defence on the above content, and introduce the detailed handling process to the teachers.

· Among them, data preprocessing includes missing value and duplicate value processing, cosine similarity calculation, sparse matrix conversion, etc. Data association analysis includes using Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms for association analysis, and discovering association rules between features by setting confidence thresholds; Data clustering analysis includes using the K-means method to classify and cluster related results for visualization.

## Academic Experience
📆 2023.9-2024.1  
💼 Financial Data Mining  

· Investment Analysis of Listed Companies: Obtain data from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, select indicators such as overall scale model, investment efficiency, and value growth, to use principal component analysis model to extract comprehensive principal components and conduct ranking. Select the top 20 or 40 stocks to construct an investment portfolio and calculate the return for a certain holding period. Meanwhile, compare the return with the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index for the same period and conduct a quantitative investment analysis.  

· Stock Price Prediction: Select indicators such as trend, overbought and oversold, and popularity, and use these indicators as independent variables. The dependent variable takes the direction of stock price rise and fall on the next trading day, with an increase represented by +1, otherwise it is -1. Calculate the independent and dependent variables with a certain calculation period as training samples, and calculate the dependent variable with a subsequent period as testing samples to predict the direction of its rise and fall to complete the design and analysis of the quantitative investment.  

· Morphological Feature Extraction Based on Key Price Points: Based on actual stock trading data, extract the morphological characteristics of price fluctuations, use the clustering analysis method to automatically cluster the morphological characteristic data, and calculate the average return rate of each class of stocks with a future holding period of one month based on the clustering results. Then, the top 5 stocks with the highest average class return are labeled as +1 classes, and the remaining stocks are labeled as -1 classes as training samples, which are trained using a support vector machine model. Finally, use the trained SVM model to predict the new stock price morphology feature data to derive a quantitative trading strategy.

📆 2023.5  
💼 Data Mining Course Application

· Use Python to model the bank loan behavior, and use data mining techniques to find and analyze the relationship between different population characteristics (education level, personal asset scale, married or not) and bank loan behavior. The specific steps successively include data set selection, data preprocessing, data association analysis, and data clustering analysis. And make an academic defense on the above content, and introduce the detailed handling process to the teachers.

· Among them, data preprocessing includes missing value and duplicate value processing, cosine similarity calculation, sparse matrix conversion, etc. Data association analysis includes using Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms for association analysis, and discovering association rules between features by setting confidence thresholds; Data clustering analysis includes using the K-means method to classify and cluster related results for visualization.
